- Links/buttons for logging in, exploring charities, and donating.  
- Display the wedding date with a countdown.  
- Highlight charity statistics (e.g., total donations).  

### 2. **User Authentication**  
- Registration: Collect user information (Name, email, password) using Django forms.  
- Login/Logout: Leverage Django’s built-in authentication system with user-friendly views and session management.  

### 3. **Dashboard**  
- Display personalized greetings using dynamic Django templates.  
- Show donation history and progress.  
- Enable users to set and track donation goals through integrated Django views.

### 4. **Charity Pages (CRUD Features)**  
- Showcase multiple charities with detailed descriptions, images, and fundraising goals.  
- Allow admin users to create, update, and delete charity profiles through Django’s admin interface and custom views.  
- Optionally, enable commenting or "likes" on charity pages using Django forms for enhanced engagement.

### 5. **Responsive Design**  
- Utilize Bootstrap along with custom CSS to create a modern, responsive design.  
- Ensure full compatibility across devices with Django’s static files management.

### 6. **API Integration**  
- **External API:** Integrate with external payment processors (e.g., PayPal or Stripe) via Django views to display live donation progress and handle secure payments.

## **Back-End Features**

### 4. **Donation Management**  
- Implement CRUD functionality for managing donations through Django views and forms.  
- Generate donation receipts and send confirmation emails using Django’s email utilities.

### 5. **Automated Testing**  
- Utilize Django’s `unittest` framework to rigorously test views, forms, and API endpoints.
